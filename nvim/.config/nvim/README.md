# Neovim from Scratch

<img width="1600" alt="CleanShot 2022-12-30 at 17 50 17@2x" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/423798/210118684-9edb3694-e430-4fa3-90f4-72316e6f5766.png">

This is a starter Neovim configuration meant to act as a jumping-off point for
new Neovim users or those who have declared config bankruptcy.

## Why?

Neovim is a fantastic source code editor out of the box, but with a little help
can provide a truly feature-rich development environment that matches (or
exceeds) alternative offerings.

The leg work involved in going from a blank `init.lua` to a useful daily driver
can be intimidating. This repo provides a handy starting point so that you can
begin using Neovim right away while building your own [Personalized Development
Environment].

## Getting started

Clone the project into your [$XDG_CONFIG_HOME] directory (usually `~/.config`)
as `nvim`:

    git clone https://github.com/ngscheurich/nvim-from-scratch ~/.config/nvim

The next time you launch Neovim, the configuration will be applied and the
[plugin manager][lazy.nvim] should start doing its thing.

## What’s included

The core Neovim experience is configured with sensible settings and examples of
key mappings, autocommands, and abbreviations are included.

Additionally, a handful of plugins are configured to augment the user
interface, tap into powerful features like the native [LSP] client and
[tree-sitter] integration, and extend Neovim’s already powerful text editing
capabilities.

Files are organized in a way that makes things succinct and easy to find:

    ~/.config/nvim
    ├── init.lua
    └── lua
       └── config
          ├── abbrevs.lua
          ├── commands.lua
          ├── keymaps.lua
          ├── options.lua
          └── plugins
             ├── init.lua
             └── ...

#### Code Intelligence

Plugins that enable a rich source code editing experience.

#### Source Control

Plugins that integrate with source sontrol systems.

- [lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim]: Buffer-level Git integration
- [tpope/vim-fugitive]: Wrapper for running arbitrary Git commands

#### Miscellaneous

Plugins that don't neatly fit into any other category.

- [NvChad/nvim-colorizer.lua]: Highlight color strings
- [tpope/vim-rsi]: Readline bindings for insert and command line mode
- [tpope/vim-unimpaired]: Handy bracket-based mappings for paired commands

## What next?

This is meant to be a starting point! Once you’re comfortable, here are some
ways you might start making it your own:

- Try out a new [colorscheme]
- Define some additional keymaps
- Test out some more built-in Telescope [pickers]
- Write some new [snippets]

And of course, don’t be afraid to explore the Neovim [plugin ecosystem]!
